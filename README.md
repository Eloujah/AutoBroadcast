# AutoBroadcast

AutoBroadcast is a 1.17.X AutoBroadcasting plugin with full support for MiniMessage/Adventure components.

See the documentation: https://docs.conch.rocks/autobroadcast

## Support

Before looking for support please consult the documentation linked above. Otherwise, support is available here:
https://paradaux.io/discord 

This support is a courtesy and not a service. 

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome, but merges are not guaranteed. I don't appreciate PRs which essentially re-write the plugin
without contacting me prior. 

## Tasks

- [ ] New version checking and notification system
- [ ] Provide French Localisation
- [ ] Croudin integration for public contributions of localisations
- [ ] Fancy github badges
- [ ] CD
- [ ] Add configuration support for titles, sounds and that sort of thing. 

Feature suggestions are always welcome, however this is aiming to be a simple and lightweight plugin, so it's unlikely
I'll implement everything.
