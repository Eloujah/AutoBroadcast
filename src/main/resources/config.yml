# To allow for the continued release of updates, I keep a track of how many people are using AutoBroadcast. You can see for yourself here:

bstats_enabled: true

# bStats does not collect any personal data. Most of the collected data is information about the plugin's server like player count, online mode,
#  Minecraft version, Java version, and more. All data gets sent and stored completely anonymously. Server IPs are only stored for ratelimiting
# and not linked to the data. All data that is collected is publicly visible. If you are interested in what data is collected for your Minecraft
# server, take a look at the pages for the plugins on your server. Please note that plugin authors can also send data that is customized for their plugin.

# Force-disabling bStats

# If you don't trust me, and my settings bstats has its own system to disable plugins' bstats.

# Disabling bStats

# If you don't want bStats to collect data from your server, you can disable it in the bStats config file. This file can be found in the /plugins/bStats/ folder.
# bStats has nearly no effect on your server's performance and the sent data is completely anonymous. The collected data is important information for plugin authors
# to improve their plugins and keep motivated. To value their work and effort, please keep bStats enabled.
